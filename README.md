# Monefy-web
Monefy-web is a simple web layer for the analysis of financial records generated by the free to use [Monefy](http://www.monefy.me/) app. 

## How does it work?
Simply export your Monefy financial records as a CSV file and import it into [FILL IN PAGES URL]. No personal data is tracked, shared or published. You then get presented a visual overview and some simple analysis of your financials. Happy budgetting!
